💡 I am an aspiring **Full Stack Web Developer** and **Engineering student** passionate about creating clean, responsive, and meaningful digital experiences.

🚀 I’m currently exploring both **web technologies** and **core technical domains** like **MATLAB simulations**, **IoT**, and **renewable energy systems**.

🛠️ I enjoy solving problems through **JavaScript**, **C++**, and **MATLAB**, and love building meaningful interfaces (like my [Wedding Invitation Website](https://github.com/Omtambe99/Wedding-invitation-website-)).

🔋 I recently worked on a **PV-based Electric Vehicle Charging System** using MATLAB/Simulink that simulates energy-efficient off-grid charging!

💬 I believe in **clear communication**, **adaptability**, and **never-ending learning** — whether it's tech, team-building, or travel 🌍

🎯 I’ve also participated in sports (inter-IIIT volleyball 🏐), NCC Alpha grade cadet 🎖️, and tech fests during my time at **IIITA**.
